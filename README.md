# Evolution of Young's Modulus in Hydrating Cement Paste

This repository contains the experimental datasets used in the study:

**"A predictive model for the evolution of Young's modulus during cement hydration"**
*Submitted to Cement and Concrete Research*
Manuscript ID: CEMCON-D-25-02235

The data support the development and validation of an analytical model predicting the time-dependent Young’s modulus of cement paste throughout hydration.
